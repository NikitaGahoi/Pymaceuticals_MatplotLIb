Analysis
In this study, 249 mice with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimen and their tumor development was measured for 45 days to study the potency of different drugs. Conclusions drawn from the analysis suggest:

In an ideal scenario, the values for duplicate mice by ID number and Timepoint(mouse ID-g989), should have been kept after removing the duplicates, however, since the data varied for each timepoint (except for 0 days), that mouse ID was dropped to clean the data

Out of 10 drug regimens, 4 drugs were analyzed in detail, of which the values of final tumor volume for Capomulin and Ramicane were less than the Infubinol and Ceftamin. However, the analysis was performed on the final tumor volume, in order to check the effectiveness of the drug in reducing the tumor volume, a comparison of all the data points (or at least the 0 timepoint and 45-day Timepoint) should have been more appropriate.

The weight of the mice and the average tumor size showed a positive correlation (0.84).

The mean and median values for Capomulin and Ramicane are significantly less as compared to the other drugs, it could be possible that the drugs reduced the tumor over time (constantly), therefore both mean and median values are very close and less, it might be possible that the tumor size for both the regimens were small from the beginning. A deeper analysis would provide a fuller picture of the effectiveness of these drugs
